# python-3-solutions-machine-learning-coursera
Python 3 solutions to the eight programming assignments in Andrew Ngâ€™s "machine learning" class on coursera.
The solutions are in Jupyter notebook format, so that all plots cells are visible online and included in the file.

I follow the MATLAB code provided with the exercises and replace MATLAB functions with the equivalent python functions/libraries where applicable. 
However, there is no use of existing python libraries (such as scikit-learn) to skip steps in the exercises.
Therefore the solutions mimic the MATLAB code provided with the assignments.
