# python-3-solutions-machine-learning-coursera
Python 3 solutions to the programming assignments in Andrew Ngâ€™s "machine learning" class on coursera.
The solutions are in Jupyter notebook format, so that it is easier to follow the exercises' steps and the plots cells are visible online and included in the file.

I follow the MATLAB code provided with the exercises and replace MATLAB functions with the equivalent python functions/libraries where applicable. 
There is no use of existing python modules (e.g. scikit-learn) to skip steps in exercises, such as explicitly writing functions.
