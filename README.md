# python-3-solutions-machine-learning-coursera
Python 3 solutions to the eight programming assignments in Andrew Ngâ€™s "machine learning" class on coursera.
The solutions are in Jupyter notebook format, so that all plots cells are visible online and included in the file.

I follow the MATLAB code provided with the exercises and replace MATLAB functions with the equivalent python functions/libraries where applicable. 
There is no use of existing python modules (such as scikit-learn) to skip steps, such as writing functions explicitly.
